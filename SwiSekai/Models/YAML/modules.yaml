          text: "Swift is a type-safe language, meaning that every variable has a specific type, such as '**Int**' for integers, '**String**' for text, or '**Bool**' for boolean values. You can explicitly specify the type of a variable using a colon, like '**var name: String = \"Sophia\"**', or let Swift infer the type from the initial value."
