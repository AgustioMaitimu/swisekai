        content:
          text: "The goal is to loop through numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'. If it's divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. Otherwise, just print the number."

        content:
          text: "You will need a `for-in` loop and `if/else if/else` statements. The 'modulo' operator, `%`, will be very helpful for checking divisibility. For example, `number % 3 == 0` is true if `number` is perfectly divisible by 3."
